			<p class="text-col">Other than three years in Aberdeen, MD, when I was a young lad, I spent my
				childhood growing up in the Monadnock region of New Hampshire. It was a great place to
				 grow up, out in the country, surrounded by forest and mountains. I developed a love of 
				 skiing, hiking and nature. It's also home to the 
				 <a href="https://hancocktownlibrarynh.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Hancock Town
					Library</a>, where my mother helps to organize the annual book sale.</p>

			<h4 class="sh-col">The CZECH REPUBLIC</h4>
		
			<p class="text-col">After Hancock, the place I lived in the longest would be Prague, capital of 
				the Czech Republic. 
				The photo above shows Prague Castle on the hill, and below it the <i>"Mala Strana,"</i> or 
				"Lesser Town." I loved the vibrant theatre scene in the Czech Republic, and I was frequently 
				involved in putting on plays with my friends, either acting, building sets, stage-managing or 
				occasionally puppeteering. I also taught languages: English, Spanish and French. Theatre and
				 languages are two passions of mine.
				 I also used to visit friends in Moravia, in the Eastern part of the country. South Moravia 
				 is wine country, and occasionally I got to help my friends tend their vinyards.<br>
				 My last play in Prague was with <a href="https://catnipdivadlo.com/" target="_blank">
                CATNIP Divadlo</a>.

			<p class="text-col">Before moving to Prague, I lived in France for two years. I had a job as
				 an English language 
			teaching assistant at the <i>Universit&eacute; de Franche-Comt&eacute;</i> in the city of 
			Besan&ccedil;on. It was a small city of about 100,000 people. I lived in the centre, which 
			is very well preserved. A fortified city since pre-roman times, most of the defenses you can 
			find there date to the seventeenth century, and were designed during the Thirty Years War by 
			the military architect, Vauban.<br>
			<br>
			I also lived in England and Spain, but that was before I owned a digital camera, so I have
			fewer photos from that chapter of my life. Those that I have are mostly in a box somewhere
			in New Hampshire</p>

			<p class="text-col">After moving to Minnesota, I started working for 
				<a href="http://tigeroxpainting.com/" target="_blank">TigerOx Painting</a>. 
				It's a small, family-style business of people who love old houses and like working on them.
				It was fun to learn, not just painting, but the holistic approach to preservation that the
				company takes. Just as fun are the spirited discussions and debates on everything from 
				philosophy to history to folklore to basketball that regularly take place among this
				erudite group of craftspeople.</p>
